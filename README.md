# Boompocalypse-pygame
A quirky take on the classic arcade game "Kaboom" where the player catches bombs in a dumpster while avoiding a killer robot. Made in pygame.

Move the player with the directional arrows. Jump with spacebar. Push the dumpster by holding 'z' and running into it. Protect yourself with a riot shield by holding 'a'. When the dumpster becomes sufficiently full, a trashtruck will appear. Empty the dumpster by pushing it into the trash truck, standing near it, and holding 'x'.
